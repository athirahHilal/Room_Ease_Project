# Room_Ease_Project
My final‑year project earned me second place in my batch.

This user manual provides comprehensive guidance for using the Room Ease Portal, a mobile application developed as part of my Final Year Project at UPTM. The app is designed to improve the efficiency of staff room management by replacing a previously manual, Excel-based system with a streamlined digital solution.

The manual explains how different users—admins, staff, and students—can interact with the application based on their roles. It covers features such as:

//Role-based access control: Tailored interfaces and permissions for each user type.

//Real-time notifications: Automatic SMS alerts via Twilio and email notifications via SendGrid.

//3D interactive room navigation: Built using Mapedin to allow users to easily locate rooms.

//User authentication and data storage: Managed with Pocketbase for real-time backend support.

This manual is intended to help users understand the features, setup process, and navigation of the Room Ease Portal, ensuring a smooth and effective experience for all roles within the UPTM ecosystem.
