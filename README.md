# Room_Ease_Project
My final‑year project earned me second place in my batch.

# 📱 Room Ease Portal

**Room Ease Portal** is a mobile application developed for my Final Year Project at UPTM. The app replaces a manual Excel-based system by providing a smart, role-based platform for managing staff room access and navigation within the campus.

This README serves as a user manual and technical overview of the project.
